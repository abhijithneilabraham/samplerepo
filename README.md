# Kodekochikode
Repo we will be using to complete the kodekochikode hackathon



https://www.gupshup.io/developer/docs/bot-platform/guide/a-hello-world-bot


trying the above link for now


tried ngrok.


tried to use angular to get a localhost and used the ngrok port as same,ie localhost 4200
I think it is wise to just host a localhost server and implement the chatbot in it.

by the way, the hosting command didnt work as said in this link, so I typed in
python3 -m http.server 8000
